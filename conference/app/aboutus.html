									<h3>YURC</h3>
									<p>Welcome to the first annual national undergraduate research conference held at Yale: YURC 2017! Open to the public, YURC will feature 70 selected poster presenters and 10 plenary speakers over the course of 2 days. Your projects span disciplines in STEM, social sciences, and humanities. We hope that our three poster sessions will spark rich conversation and insight.</p>
									<p>We hope that the research and personal stories of our keynote speakers, Dean Jonathan Holloway, Professor Brian Scholl, Professor Jonathan Ellman, and Professor Joan Steitz, will inspire excite you. Their talks will be complimented by workshops about commercializing your research, applying for national and international fellowships, and starting your own undergraduate research association and panels about some possible next steps: continuing research in academia and industry or pursuing medical school.</p>
									<p>Sponsored by the Sigma Xi Research Society and the Yale Science and Quantitative Reasoning Office and hosted by the Yale Undergraduate Research Association, YURC aspires to celebrate the diversity and high caliber of research produced by undergraduates in STEM, social sciences, and the humanities for many years to come.</p>
								</br>
									<h3>YURA</h3>
									<p>The Yale Undergraduate Research Association (YURA) is dedicated to connecting disciplines, resources, and individuals to promote undergraduate research. Founded by students in 2015, we believe in building lasting connections between students and research through personal interaction and new media. By building a community around interdisciplinary research at Yale, we seek to become the starting point from which undergraduates learn about new opportunities, find mentors, and begin research. Our first major initiatives include the Yale Research Database, a comprehensive, searchable directory of over 1,400 Yale faculty in all departments and YURC 2017. Learn more about YURA at <a href="http://yura.yale.edu">yura.yale.edu</a>.</p>
