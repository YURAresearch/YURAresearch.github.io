					<h3>About the Conference</h3>
					<p style="margin: 30px 0 0">YURC 2017 is the first national undergraduate research conference held at Yale. Poster sessions on the first day will celebrate 90 diverse undergraduate researchers and their innovative projects, spanning disciplines in the humanities, social sciences, and STEM. Graduate student and sponsored judges will evaluate and award top projects in each category. On the second day, 10 select student plenary speakers will have the opportunity to individually showcase their research to all attendees. Hosted by the Yale Undergraduate Research Association, the conference will also feature esteemed keynote speakers from the Yale community and panel workshops on continuing education and careers across disciplines.
          </p></br><p>We hope that you join us in celebrating the diversity and quality of undergraduate research around the country and in exchanging new and exciting ideas. All are welcome to attend!</p>

						<h6>Frequently Asked Questions</h6>
					</br>
					<ol>
						<li><b>1. Who can apply to be a presenter?</b></li>
						<p>All undergraduates currently enrolled at any accredited college or university can apply for YURC 2017. You must have conducted your research while enrolled.</p>
						</br>
						<li><b>2. Can I apply if I don’t do research in fields like biology, chemistry and physics?</b></li>
						<p>Yes, Yes, Yes! We encourage students doing research in ANY field to apply to YURC. This includes the arts, humanities, social sciences, sciences, engineering, mathematics, and many others. Our application asks you to please select one of our official nine categories:
						<ul>
							<li>Humanities</li>
							<li>Social Sciences</li>
							<li>Ecology and Environmental Science</li>
							<li>Biology and Biochemistry</li>
							<li>Chemistry</li>
							<li>Engineering (Biomedical, Chemical, Electrical, Mechanical)</li>
							<li>Mathematics</li>
							<li>Physics and Astronomy</li>
							<li>Computer Science and Robotics</li>
						</ul></p>
						<p>If you feel that your research is not adequately described by any of the above or spans multiple categories, please feel free to contact us for help selecting a category (email: yura@yale.edu).</p>
						</br>
						<li><b>3. What if I am not done with my research by the registration deadline?</b></li>
						<p>That’s okay! If you are not finished with your research by the deadline [12/8/16], please submit a preliminary abstract that reflects your hypotheses and topic and provides projected results or future directions. You’ll have some more time to finish your project, as finalized abstracts and posters or powerpoint talks for selected presenters will be due later in January.</p>
						</br>
						<li><b>4. Can I present research that was not conducted at my home institution?</b></li>
						<p>Absolutely! Research conducted anywhere by undergraduates is eligible for submission to YURC. For example, if you did summer internship work at an institution other than your college or university or even in your home, it is eligible.</p>
						</br>
						<li><b>5. Are group project submissions allowed?</b></li>
						<p>It is perfectly fine to register for the conference as a group! It is up to you to decide how you would like to structure your presentation. You can present individually or as a group for the poster presentation if selected. Please indicate if how you intend to present in your application. Note that multiple people who were part of the same group project wishing to present should submit a single application as a group.</p>
						</br>
						<li><b>6. How are projects selected and by whom? When will I know if my project is selected?</b></li>
						<p>Poster projects are selected by student peer-review. A panel of students with research experience in your self-selected category will compare your submitted application, including your abstract and short personal statement, to others in your category. Applications are blinded to student gender, institution, age or year, and background unless you choose to discuss these factors in brief in your personal statement. This way there is no advantage to selecting a particular category, and you can be sure your work is only compared to that of peers in your field.  No favor is given to Yalies over students from other institutions. Finally, an oversight panel consisting of the board of student-run Yale Undergraduate Research Association will review all projects in each category and the committee selections to ensure fairness. This oversight panel will also select the ten plenary speakers across the categories among applicants who state that they would like to be considered for that role in their application. Selected applicants will be notified by January 9th, 2017.</p>
						</br>
						<li><b>7. Will there be a registration fee? What if I’m concerned about affording it?</b></li>
						<p>Applicants including Yalies selected to present posters will be requested to pay a registration fee of about $75 cover food and materials costs for the two days. Selected plenary speakers have no registration fee. Attendees will have three meals covered on both days with complimentary housing on the Yale campus. Poster printing is covered if you submit your poster to us before our deadline.</p>
						</br>
						<p>Please do not let the registration fee discourage you from participating if you are selected to present. In circumstances of financial hardship, fee waivers may be requested by emailing yura@yale.edu.</p>
						</br>
						<li><b>8. Are there housing and food provided? Do I have to stay with an assigned host at Yale? </b></li>
						<p>There is free food for all three meals on Saturday and Sunday catered by the Omni Hotel for all attendees. All selected students will be assigned a Yale student to host them according to their responses on our housing survey. If you would prefer to stay with a friend or off-campus in a hotel, we ask that you simply decline to be matched with a host.</p>
						</br>
						<li><b>9. How do I get to Yale from my home institution? Will transportation be subsidized?</b></li>
						<p>Due to the national nature of the conference and the number of participants, we will unfortunately not be able to subsidize presenter transportation this year. The best options for getting to Yale can be found on to.yale.edu. In brief, the New Haven Union train station is an Amtrak and Metro North stop, as well as a bus terminal for companies like Megabus and Peter Pan. From the train station, there are free Yale shuttles to campus. If you are flying to any of the nearby airports (Bradley Int’l, JFK, Newark, or Laguardia), please consider carpooling in an Uber or other car service to campus. For specific questions about navigating to campus, please contact us.</p>
						</br>
						<li><b>10. Do I have to attend both days of the conference? What if I have to arrive late or leave early?</b></li>
						<p>While accommodations can be made for late arrival or early departure, we request that all applicants be able to attend a majority of both days of the conference. Please let us know in your application if you anticipate a scheduling conflict.</p>
						</br>
						<p>If you have any additional questions, please email yura@yale.edu.</p>
